        'Born in the north of England, Keith benefited early on from a <strong>Grammar</strong> School education, which combined naturally with his hands-on ‘get stuck in’ personality.',
        'Working full time from the age of 16 to support aged parents, Keith could only study privately and over the next 25 years he secured his <strong>Business Degree, CPA qualification</strong> and finally his <strong>MBA</strong> from <strong>Oxford Brookes University</strong>.',
        'Moving to Taiwan in 2010, while working with universities and businesses, he identified the need for a more bespoke system of education; to provide a learning platform where students with very different ability levels could excel. “Creativity and Socialising Skills must go side-by-side with formal qualifications for sustainable success” he says.',
        '<strong>Determination and Professional training</strong>, forged together with <strong>Creativity and Compassion</strong>, have created a uniquely dynamic individual business leader, and Keith’s ‘never-give-up’ determination has shaped iTc’s policies and procedures.',
